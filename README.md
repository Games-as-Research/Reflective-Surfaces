# Reflective Surfaces
_An alternate timeline where digitial publications are **really** digitial._

---

The time is 10:09.


There are 9 screens. \
There are portals that move you between these screens.\
There is a desktop viewer that lets you see all the desktops you have access to, and switch between them.


You are reading text on the screen that is in windows. There are also other windows, *custom* windows. \
Windows have points or items that are clickable - This is a portal. \
The portals unlock new desktops. \
A portal is a special point you have to read and find out.


There is a specific sequence of screens that goes from Pippin to Matt to Rilla to Chip to Kalervo to Enric to Femke to Vadim to Shahrom. \
There are forward and backward portals. \
The objective is to go through the whole thing from pippin's screen, read through, and make a commit on shahrom's screen. \
There are windows on each screen. \
There are external links on some windows in some screens. \
There are easter eggs on each screen: recursive videos, screen invader, audio playback, p5js embedding, etc. 

100 percent completion gives you a fake dollar bill.
