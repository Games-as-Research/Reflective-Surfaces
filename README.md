# Reflective Surfaces
_An alternate timeline where digitial publications are **really** digitial._

The time is 10:09, on December 1st, 2022. The day of the first Games as Research meeting.

Initially the idea was to develop custom windows and refined interactions but the more I developed it and thought of the concept we were illustrating with this paper, the less it made sense to engineer custom CSS programmings of GitHub Desktop windows and Discord chats because while a nice easter egg, it was not the argument.

Moreover, it was also _counterproductive_ because we were making a normative argument about how publications should/could be. Code is expensive. We can not engineer such a specific solution and expect people to take it up as a mode of publication. It had to remain low entry to implement or even low entry to adopt this system for their own purpose.

The way Reflective Surfaces is currently implemented, anyone can change the screenshots, comment out a few lines, change some text and illustrate their own design process. This is also the reason I'm here writing documentation - explaining what is where and why I did things the way I did them. So you, the reader, can make better assumptions when you adapt this project to something you find useful.
