There are [core components](#core-components) and then there are [gameplay elements](#gameplay-elements). 

Core components are things that the gameplay is going to depend upon in a way that the gameplay can't be made modular without them. Modular here refers to the loose coupling of components in the system. It is understood that balancing and tweaking will occur once the system is in its first playable state; game design is iterative. So if this system is not modular, making the slightest change is going to become very expensive in terms of time. 

Gameplay elements are the rules, interactions, pathways, and narrative defined on top of these core components. 

(NB: This is from a development & project management perspective and helps me think about this system clearly. You of course might see it differently.)
