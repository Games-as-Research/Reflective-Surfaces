# Reflective Surfaces 

Of the original plan, many things were removed because the closer I got to the final version - keeping in mind that this is supposed to be an alt-perspective on publications in the research creation domain - high-fidelity remakes of the screens seemed counter-intuitive & counter-productive. Development is expensive in terms of the time-cost. If we are making this and we want people to use this in the future maybe, creating custom CSS components for everything drastically increases the effort required to customize this project.
